## üé® Layout Approach
I implemented a reusable `ProductCard` component that displays the product image, name, price, variant selector, and an action button that changes to "Out of Stock" when unavailable. The design uses a clean, card-based layout with spacing, hover effects, and clear visual hierarchy for easy scanning.

## üì± Responsiveness Considerations
The card layout is built with flexible CSS and relative sizing so it adapts across desktop, tablet, and mobile. Images scale proportionally, text wraps as needed, and a single-column layout is used for narrow screens via media queries.
